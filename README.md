The outputsfinal.csv file contains the neucleotide sequence with class label and description to be given as input for CNN
The allseqfinal.txt is the fasta sequence file for all the four NDD discorder
The databeforepreprocessing.csv contains the gene id for all four NDD with other details like tax_id	Org_name	GeneID	CurrentID	Status	Symbol	Aliases	description	other_designations	map_location	chromosome	genomic_nucleotide_accession.version	start_position_on_the_genomic_accession	end_position_on_the_genomic_accession	orientation	exon_count	OMIM	Class. This file is given as input to http://metascape.org to perform gene list analysis report and to perform enrichment factor analysis
NDdisorder.ipynb fiel contains the python code for web scrapping and CNN for classification of the gene sequence based on the class label ADHD,DMD,Autism and CP.
